                        <p class="profileDesc">Alexis Wei is your president of Markham Ward 6 Youth Council for the year and she is ecstatic to find out all that she can offer. It is through the experiences being a part of this council that she is able to learn and gain leadership and communication abilities so early on in life. Alexis has a passion for fashion and dreams of having her own clothing line some day. This far fetched aspiration is accompanied by many others as anyone close to her would know her love for San Francisco and Silicon Valley. As one can tell, she is quite a dreamer and would love to hear your crazy suggestions and make it a dream come true.</p>

She is super proud of everything the council has been able to accomplish over the past few years. However, she would love to see it expand and create a larger impact on youths in the community. Don’t be fooled, she comes off as soft spoken, but once you get to know her she is quite wacky. Isabel has a passion for playing music, exploring geeky fandoms, and being involved in extracurricular activities. You’ll definitely find her in the library, worrying over life. She is thrilled to work as the Vice President of the Markham Ward 6 Youth Council this year.</p>

                        <p class="profileDesc">Katelyn is a grade 11 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau high school. She is passionate about many things like the arts, sciences, novels and much more. She’s shy at first, but once you get to know her, she’ll be a lot more comfortable and outgoing. If Katelyn comes off as unapproachable, she’s probably sleep deprived or hungry, so don’t hesitate to ask her for help or clarification. Katelyn is one of three publicity executives of 2016-2017 Markham Ward Six Youth Council and is looking forward to the following year of youth involvement.</p>

Seeing that she wasn’t going to be in Markham for at least 7 hours every weekday due to school, she worried that she wouldn’t be as involved and would miss out on super cool things in her neighbourhood.

She is the Secretary for the 2016-2017 term and is excited for another year with the council!</p>

With excruciatingly long commutes to school, an inundation of homework, and his crippling fear of productivity, he decided to join his friends and start making short films. Other ways in which he attempts to assuage his cortisol are through martial arts, computer programming and, of course, video games. Josh is concerned with the mental health of youth, and is seeking ways to mend this problem in both his school and the community. As this is his first year with Ward 6, Josh is super stoked to meet you!</p>
